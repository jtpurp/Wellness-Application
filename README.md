# Wellness-Application
A Java application intended to help improve users' mental health through journaling as well as keeping track of goals to manifest and positive self-affirmations. Each journal is uploaded to a userâ€™s journal directory for them to save and view past journal entries. I am a strong believer in caring for mental health and I developed this application as a personal project following OOP principles.
